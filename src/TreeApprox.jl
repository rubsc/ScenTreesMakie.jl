	tree_approximation!(newtree::Tree, path::Function, nIterations::Int64, p::Int64=2, r::Int64=2)

Returns a valuated probability scenario tree approximating the input stochastic process.

Args:
- *newtree* - Tree with a certain branching structure,

- *path* - function generating samples from the stochastic process to be approximated,

- *nIterations* - number of iterations for stochastic approximation procedure,

- *p* - choice of norm (default p = 2 (Euclidean distance)), and,

- *r* - transportation distance parameter
